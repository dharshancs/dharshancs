## Hi, I’m Dharshan 👋

Backend-leaning Full-Stack Developer with a strong interest in building **system-oriented web applications**.

I enjoy designing backend-heavy systems that involve:
- role-based access control
- stateful workflows
- data consistency
- admin/user separation
- real-world CRUD complexity

### 🔹 Featured Projects

  👉 Start here if you want to understand how I design systems.

- **Event Management Dashboard**  
  Backend-focused dashboard for organisers and users with live registration tracking and access control.  
  Tech: Flask, SQLite

### 🔹 What I focus on
- Backend architecture (Flask, SQL)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Designing flows before writing code
- Building projects that resemble real production systems

### 🔹 Currently
